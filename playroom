			   playroom are fun but soft to the eye.

		<h2>Cleaning is a Breeze</h2>
		<p>A well spaced areas make cleaning a very easy task, here is some tips 
		   we always follow:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Every clean-up time after playing is a task learned by the little
			   ones, the "lava" game is our best friend to make those little hands
			   pick up their toys, before they get "engulfed" by the scorchng melting
			   lava.
			</p>
			<p>the blockie furniture allows to vacum the fluffy carpet in no time
			   we don't worry about cleaning behind furniture, all eventually will
			   be moved in a rotating fashion to avoid fogoten "dust bunnies"
			</p>
